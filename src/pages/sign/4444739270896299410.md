US-20/US-26 West (Broadway Ave.) approaching Front St.  Use left lanes for Front St.  These types of US shields are not at all common in Idaho.  Almost all US shields are shown as solid white, not just white outlines.  These signs appeared after the new bridge over the Boise River was completed here.
