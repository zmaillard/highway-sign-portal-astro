SW Baker St. North at OR-99W.  SW Baker St. is the ramp that connects OR-18 eastbound to OR-99W northbound and turns into a surface street.  It is signed as OR-99W, but does not actually reach OR-99W until this light at Old Sheridan Road.  Turn right for OR-99W South to Amity and Corvallis.  Continue ahead for Linfield College and City Center (McMinnville).
