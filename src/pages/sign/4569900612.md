US-89 north approaching ID-61 (To WY-89).  Use ID-61 south for WY-89, Cokeville, and Kemmerer.  Continue north on US-89 for Afton and Jackson.  All destinations are in Wyoming.  The only instance that I have encountered where state highway shield from another state is posted in Idaho, is at this intersection.
