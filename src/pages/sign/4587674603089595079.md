I-84 - Exit 228 onramp.  Use I-84 west to Pendleton; I-84 east to La Grande.  The I-84 shield has the text OREGON in it, although it does not fit well with the rest of the font.  This is the first time in the last 20 years I have lived in the northwest that I have seen an interstate shield with the text OREGON in it.
