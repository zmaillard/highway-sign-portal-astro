I-10 west at Exit 93 - CA-60/Riverside.  I-10 continues west towards San Bernardino and Los Angeles.  CA-60 parallels I-10 to the south into Los Angeles.  Although the sign does not mention it, either route can be used for Los Angeles.  An old US-60 shield can be sign peeking out from behind the CA-60 shield.
