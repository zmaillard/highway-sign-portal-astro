The international bounday between United States and Canada at the Easport,ID/Kingsgate, BC border crossing.  The picture is taken right on the international boundary.  You can see a swath of trees cut down at the border itself, and you can see that same swath as a notch at the top of the ridge in the background.  United States is to the left - Canada to the right.
