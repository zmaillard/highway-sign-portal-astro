I-84 west at Exit 53 - Vista Ave./Boise Airport and approaching Exit 52 - Orchard St.  The stretch of I-84 between Broadway and Orchard St. is being widened and the interchanges at Exit 52 and Exit 53 are being redesigned.  The new westbound lanes and ramps are still under construction in this photograph.
