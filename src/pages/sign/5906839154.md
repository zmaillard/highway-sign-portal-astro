Teton Pass road closure information on ID-33 east approaching the Wyoming state line.  When Teton Pass is closed in Wyoming, this is where the road closure starts, just inside of Idaho.  All traffic must return to Victor Idaho when the road closure lights are flashing.  This is one of the few instances in Idaho of a state highway shield from another state located inside Idaho.
