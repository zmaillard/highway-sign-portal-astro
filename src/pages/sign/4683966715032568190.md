Milepost 90 (B) on US-395 south.  The B is because the state of Oregon maintains different internal highways along the state highway system.  Some of the signed highways (like US-395) span multiple internal highways.  In this case this is the second internal highway south from the Washington border that belongs only to US-395.  The first (Umatilla-Stanfield #54) is marked as an A on mileposts.  This is the second (B) stretch - Pendleton - John Day #28).  This type of milepost has been showing up in Oregon in the last 10 years, but not on all highways.  I have seen it on US-395 and OR-207.
