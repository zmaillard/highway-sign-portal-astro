Entering Freedom on WY-239 west - Elevation 5900; Population 214.  Freedom is the oldest community in the Star Valley, and is named because of the settlers who were free to practice polygamy in Wyoming.  The western boundary of the town is the Idaho stateline, where at the time had banned polygamy.
