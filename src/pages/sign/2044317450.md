Shields for old routes - US-195/US-2/US-10/US-395 on Maple Street.  This is interesting in a few ways.  First of all, the stacking of the route numbers within the marker itself.  Secondly - US-10 is decommissioned in the western US.  US-195 used to end in Sandpoint, ID - following the current route of US-2 through Spokane.  Currently US-195 ends a few miles to the west at I-90.  Finally, there is no mention of I-90 on this sign, which is where this sign is posted at an onramp to I-90.
