I-84 east at Exit 44 - ID-69 South/Meridian/Kuna.  This interchange was rebuilt in 2015 as a SPUI.  The ID-69 shield in attached to the exit sign incorrectly has the state of Idaho filled in all black.  Normally on these types of state highway shields on freeway junctions, the state is shown white with a black outline and black text.
