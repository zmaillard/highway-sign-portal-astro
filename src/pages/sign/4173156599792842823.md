I-84/US-20/US-26/US-30 east shields.  Four highways join together between Boise and Mountain Home, which is the most overlaps of any stretch of highway in Idaho.  Notice the US highway shields are missing the surrounding black box.  This stretch of highway was recently widened, and it was probably incorrectly placed by a contractor.
