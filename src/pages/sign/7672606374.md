NV-431 east at US-395.  This is the southern end of the current US-395 freeway.  The section between NV-431 and Washoe Lake is expected to be completed in late 2012.  For US-395 north to Reno continue straight.  In late 2012, the right lanes will be for US-395 south to Carson City and South Lake Tahoe.
