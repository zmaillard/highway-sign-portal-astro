Milepost on OR-207 north - Mile 2C.  Milepost 90 (B) on US-395 south.  The C is because the state of Oregon maintains different internal highways along the state highway system.  Some of the signed highways (like OR-207) span multiple internal highways.  In this case this is the third internal highway south from the beginning of OR-207 at US-730 that belongs only to OR-207.  The first (Hermiston Highway #333) is marked as an A on mileposts.  The second (B) stretch is Lexington-Echo Highway #320.  This stretch is the third (C) stretch (Heppner-Spray Highway #321).  This type of milepost has been showing up in Oregon in the last 10 years, but not on all highways.  I have seen it on US-395 and OR-207.
