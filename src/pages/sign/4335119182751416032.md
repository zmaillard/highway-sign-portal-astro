I-15 north at Exit 113 - Exit 113.  This is the only instance of an interchange in Idaho with simply the name of its exit.  The advanced signage at this interchange is Shelley, and same as the southbound exit name.  This sign has been in place since BL-15 and US-26 was routed to the newer Exit 116 interchange.
