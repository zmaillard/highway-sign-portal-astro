Bus US-93/NV-321 South at NV-322 in Pioche.  Both NV-321 and NV-322 will end up at US-93.  Turn left to continue north on Bus. US-93/NV-321.  Continue straight for NV-322.  This is a confusing intersection because there is no signs indicating either the Nevada state highways involved, nor which street the business loop continues on as.
